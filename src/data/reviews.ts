  { quote: 'Found this company on Google. Called so easy to set up. Very professional. Driver was awesome. My flight was running a little late, he was kind, gentleman lifted my luggage in without being asked and opened my door for me and closed.  The Very Best. Abbotsford Airport to Langley. Cheaper then a cab by far. Service to customer is top notch and With large tip still way less then a cab. I love this company. Highly recommend. This is company I will be using every time. Can’t say enough things for this company.', author: 'Anonymous' },

For returning us to the airport, the driver drove all the way to Point Roberts border to pick us up and, while we were a little nervous because we had a flight to catch, the driver was very prompt, in fact, he was there five minutes prior to us getting there.

  { quote: 'I used this shuttle service around the Easter long weekend for a round trip from YVR to a private residence in Abbotsford. From booking, to pick up, the trip itself and drop off, the service was exemplary and timely on both occasions. It took the stress off family having to take time off work and drive into the city or me having to rent a car. The driver was polite, courteous and professional. I definitely recommend this company!', author: 'Rebecca Evans' },
